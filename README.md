# Data Analyst Chatbot

A bilingual (Hebrew / English) AI-powered data analysis tool built with **Streamlit** and multi-provider LLM support.

Upload a CSV, Excel, JSON, or Parquet file and ask questions in natural language — the bot generates charts, summaries, and interactive dashboards.

## Quick Start

### 1 - Local (Python 3.9+)

```bash
git clone https://github.com/Noams94/data-analyst-chatbot.git
cd data-analyst-chatbot
pip install -r requirements.txt
streamlit run app.py
```

Set your API key in the sidebar or export it as an environment variable:

```bash
export ANTHROPIC_API_KEY=sk-ant-...
streamlit run app.py
```

### 2 - Docker

```bash
docker compose up --build
# -> http://localhost:8501
```

Pass your API key via a `.env` file in the project root:

```
ANTHROPIC_API_KEY=sk-ant-...
```

---

## Configuration

| File | Purpose |
|---|---|
| `.streamlit/config.toml` | Theme colours, max upload size (200 MB), headless mode |
| `.streamlit/secrets.toml` | Store API keys securely (not committed to git) |

**`secrets.toml` example:**
```toml
ANTHROPIC_API_KEY = "sk-ant-..."
```

## Tabs

### Chat
The main conversational interface. Upload a file, ask questions, and the AI runs analyses, generates charts, and provides insights. Includes a stop button to cancel streaming responses mid-generation.

### AI Dashboard
A chat-driven dashboard builder. Describe what you want in natural language (e.g., "create a bar chart of sales by region") and the AI uses tool-calling to create, modify, reorder, and delete charts. Charts are rendered as interactive Plotly visualisations with drag-and-drop arrangement.

### Dashboard
Manual chart builder with 8 chart types (Bar, Line, Area, Pie, Histogram, Scatter, Box Plot, Heatmap) and 16 colour palettes. Add charts to a multi-column dashboard layout and export as interactive HTML.

### Data
Browse the uploaded dataset with search, filtering, and data quality diagnostics.

## Running Tests

```bash
pip install pytest
pytest tests/ -v
```

## Tech Stack

- **Frontend:** Streamlit
- **AI:** chatlas + Anthropic / OpenAI / Google / Groq / Ollama
- **Data:** pandas, numpy
- **Charts:** matplotlib + seaborn (AI chat), Plotly (builder, dashboard, AI dashboard)
- **PDF:** fpdf2 + python-bidi (Hebrew RTL support)
- **Email:** smtplib (stdlib)

---

## Analysis Architecture

### Tool Pipeline

The AI uses **4 registered tools** via function-calling (managed by `chatlas`):

| # | Tool | Purpose |
|---|------|---------|
| 1 | `get_data_overview()` | Initial scan — schema, dtypes, nulls, stats, sample rows |
| 2 | `run_analysis(pandas_code)` | Execute pandas / numpy code on the dataset |
| 3 | `create_chart(...)` | Generate matplotlib + seaborn visualisations (PNG) |
| 4 | `suggest_next_analyses()` | Propose smart follow-up questions |

### Chain-of-Thought Process

Every AI response follows a strict order enforced by the system prompt:

1. **Understand** — call `get_data_overview()` to inspect the dataset structure
2. **Compute** — call `run_analysis()` with pandas code to calculate exact numbers
3. **Report** — write the answer using only numbers produced by the analysis
4. **Visualise** — call `create_chart()` for every key finding

### Code Execution — `run_analysis()`

Uses a split exec / eval pattern in a sandboxed namespace:

- The DataFrame is **copied** before execution (original data is never mutated)
- **No access** to the filesystem, network, or OS commands
- Results are capped at **50 rows x 20 columns**
- All executed code is saved and displayed to the user in the Code panel

### Chart Generation — `create_chart()`

**Supported chart types:** bar, barh, line, scatter, hist, box, pie, heatmap, count

**Parameters:** `x_column`, `y_column`, `aggregation` (sum / mean / count / median / max / min), `color_column`, `top_n`, `bins`, `sort`

### Dashboard Charts (Plotly)

The interactive chart builder and dashboards use Plotly with modern styling:

- **16 colour palettes** — sequential, diverging, and qualitative
- **Custom hover tooltips** — per-chart-type templates with thousands separators
- **Animated entry** — CSS fade-in on chart mount + Plotly transitions
- **Theme-aware** — all colours adapt to dark / light mode

### Guardrails

The system prompt enforces strict rules:

- **Never** fabricate or estimate numbers — only report computed results
- **Never** modify, delete, or write back to the user's data
- **Never** access external URLs, files, APIs, or OS commands
- If unsure about a number, run additional code to verify

---

## Security Notes

- API keys are stored in-memory only (session state) and never written to disk
- The app password for email is never persisted between sessions
- User input is capped at **2,000 characters** per message
- AI requests are rate-limited to **30 per session**
- Files larger than **100,000 rows** are automatically sampled

---

## Enabling Light Mode

The app ships in **dark-only mode**, but all light mode code is already built-in and ready to activate. To enable the light/dark theme toggle:

### Step 1 — Uncomment the toggle button in `app.py`

Search for `Theme toggle (disabled` (~line 3601) and uncomment the 4 lines:

```python
# Before (disabled):
# _theme_label = T["theme_btn_light"] if st.session_state.theme == "dark" else T["theme_btn_dark"]
# if st.button(_theme_label, use_container_width=True, key="theme_toggle"):
#     st.session_state.theme = "light" if st.session_state.theme == "dark" else "dark"
#     st.rerun()

# After (enabled):
_theme_label = T["theme_btn_light"] if st.session_state.theme == "dark" else T["theme_btn_dark"]
if st.button(_theme_label, use_container_width=True, key="theme_toggle"):
    st.session_state.theme = "light" if st.session_state.theme == "dark" else "dark"
    st.rerun()
```

### Step 2 — Update `.streamlit/config.toml`

Change the theme base and colours to light:

```toml
[theme]
base                     = "light"
primaryColor             = "#10a37f"
backgroundColor          = "#ffffff"
secondaryBackgroundColor = "#f5f5f5"
textColor                = "#1a1a1a"
```

### Step 3 — Restart Streamlit

```bash
streamlit run app.py
```

A **☀️ Light Mode / 🌙 Dark Mode** toggle button will appear at the bottom of the sidebar. All colours, charts, and native components (including DataFrames) will adapt automatically.
